## Problem

The main goal of our project is prediction of pneumonia and defining the stage of the disease depending on chest X-rays.

Pneumonia is a lung infection that can sometimes lead to severe or life-threatening illness and even death. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection or a virus.
This disease is a great threat to people, especially children and adults over the age of 65. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under 5: pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children.

To understand the general situation here is an infographic provided. We can see that although the number of pneumonia cases slightly decreases, it still causes a lot of deaths.


And of course, the coronavirus disease had a major impact on the world. About 15% of COVID-19 cases are severe and cause pneumonia. And about 5% of people have critical infections and need a ventilator.

It is very important to make a diagnosis in time and start treatment immediately. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiography (X-rays) is frequently used for diagnosis. X-ray imaging is considered a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive examination of the lungs. But the problem is that the contrast in chest X-ray images is rather low, and it sometimes makes manual evaluation inefficient. Besides, X-ray images have similar region information for different diseases, such as lung cancer.

And that is where computers and AI can help. Computer-aided diagnosis can enhance efficiency and lead to timely treatment.


## Data

Our dataset:
* [Pneumonia X-Ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/pcbreviglieri/pneumonia-xray-images/discussion)

It is well splitted - it consists of 3 directories: train, test and validation, each of which contains other 2 directories: the first one with X-Rays of pneumonia and the second one with normal lungs. Besides, it suits well for the use of machine and deep learning.

Example of X-Rays with normal lungs:
